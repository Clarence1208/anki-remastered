# Welcome to our Clean Code project called Anki-Remastered

#### This project is made with NestJS, is designed with a Hexagonal Architecture and developed with a Clean Code approach / TDD. 

# NEST API

### To get started

 After you cloned the project in your local files, you can go in the api folder with `cd anki-remastered-api`

### Then you will need to fetch all dependencies needed to run the api, for that you can run
`npm ci` that will fetch dependencies in the `package.json`file

## Testing

### Before running the tests you will need to run

```bash
  npm run build
```

This command will build the project and create a `dist` folder where you can find the compiled code

#### All tests are in the `test` folder

To run the tests you can run the command:

```bash
  npm run test
```

or if you want to have the coverage with it too

```bash
  npm run test:cov
```
